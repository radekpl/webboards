WebBoards
=========

<b>Work in progress...</b>

WebBoards is a game engine for playing online adaptations of board wargames.  
Is inspired by [VASSAL](http://www.vassalengine.org/), but allows play diractly via browser.

Goals:
  * Running on desktop and smartphones
  * No software installation 
  * Bookmarkable games
  * Instant updates when your opponent is online
  * Integrated [PBEM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play-by-mail_game)-like log support (for I-go U-go games)
  * Game rules implementation

Implementation is based on [SVG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics), 
[GWT](https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/) and runs on 
[Google App Engine](https://developers.google.com/appengine/)

The first game being implemented is [MMP](http://www.multimanpublishing.com/Products/tabid/58/ProductID/69/Default.aspx)'s
[Bastogne: Screaming Eagles under Siege](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/35669/bastogne-screaming-eagles-under-siege).
